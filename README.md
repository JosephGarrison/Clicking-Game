# Clicking-Game
A simple clicking game in C-sharp using WPF

This is my first C# project that isn't a script for a game made in the Unity engine.

This game is based on the SkillShare course "C# & WPF: Create The Clicking Game!" by Lukas Vyhnalek

I took the base tutorial a few steps further by adding a high score and preventing the player from creating an infinite amount of boxes to click which would allow them to get a higher score than normally possible. 

If I come back to this project future updates may include:
  1. more colored boxes, maybe a red box will deduct from the player score, 
  2. Allowing the player to alter the amount of play time
  3. Save states, allowing the player to quit the program and see their preveious score(s) when they open it again later.
  4. IDK, the world is my oyster.
